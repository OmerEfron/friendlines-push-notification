# News-Style Feed Design Document

## Overview

This design transforms Friendlines from a traditional social media app into a news-style platform where personal updates are presented as professional news articles. The app will mimic the visual design and user experience of major news applications while displaying personal "newsflashes" from friends and family in third-person narrative style.

## Architecture

### Visual Design System

**News Brand Identity:**
- Primary colors: Deep red (#C41E3A), navy blue (#1B365D), white (#FFFFFF)
- Secondary colors: Light gray (#F5F5F5), dark gray (#333333), gold accent (#FFD700)
- Typography: Bold sans-serif headlines (Roboto Condensed Bold), serif body text (Georgia)
- News-style iconography: Breaking news badges, category icons, trending indicators

**Layout Hierarchy:**
- Header: News network-style branding with navigation tabs
- Hero Section: Featured/breaking news stories
- Main Feed: Article-style cards with headlines, previews, and metadata
- Sidebar: Trending topics, quick updates, weather-style widgets
- Bottom Navigation: News section tabs instead of traditional social tabs

## Error Handling
